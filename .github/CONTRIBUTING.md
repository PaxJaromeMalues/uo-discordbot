# Contributing to UO Discord Bot

As a contributor, if you are unsure or not fully confident in the code you've written, feel free to submit the pull request anyway. There are guards in place and a review process for a reason and you won't get in trouble for submitting a pull request that needs to be edited. So if you have written something to contribute to the project or resolve a feature request or issue, go ahead and submit it once you think it's finished!

## Prior to Contributing

If you wish to be a contributor for the project, or an admin/code owner for the repository, please contact Synxe on Discord or [callensm](https://github.com/callensm) on GitHub. You will need to be added to the test environment Discord server that is used for development and vetting of new features and bug fixing, and added to the United Operations GitHub organization and the `UO Discord` development team within the organization.

The technology stack being used for the project is `TypeScript` for development, shell scripts for maintenance and some automation, and `Docker` and `Terraform` for containerization and deployments to the cloud server.

> _If you are proficient in any of these or thing that you can add value to the project in another way, feel free to let me know! I'm always open to innovation!_
